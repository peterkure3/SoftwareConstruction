# Red, Green, Refactor Report

## Red Phase

During the Red phase, the focus was on defining the unit tests for the Calculator class without any implementation. Tests were written to cover various functionalities such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, sine, cosine, tangent, square root, and cube root operations. Each test case was intentionally designed to fail initially, as the Calculator class had not been implemented yet. This phase aimed to clearly outline the expected behavior of the Calculator class.

## Green Phase

In the Green phase, the Calculator class was implemented to satisfy the requirements specified in the test cases. The methods (add, subtract, multiply, divide, sin, cos, tan, sqrt, cbrt) were written to perform basic arithmetic operations and trigonometric functions. The goal was to make sure that the implemented methods passed all the previously written test cases. This phase was successful when all the unit tests turned green, indicating that the Calculator class met the specified functionality.

## Refactor Phase

During the Refactor phase, the code was reviewed to identify areas for improvement and optimization. The focus was on enhancing code readability, efficiency, and adherence to best practices. Some potential areas for refactoring include adding appropriate comments and docstrings, improving variable names, and addressing any code smells. The goal was to maintain passing test cases while making the code more maintainable and following PEP 8 style guidelines.

### Challenges Faced

1. *Error Handling in Division:*
   - A challenge was encountered in handling division by zero. The implementation was modified to raise a ValueError when attempting to divide by zero, providing a more informative error message.

2. *Test Case Design:*
   - Ensuring comprehensive test coverage for various scenarios required careful consideration. All edge cases, such as zero values and potential corner cases, were taken into account during test case design.

### Rationale Behind Refactoring

1. *Docstrings and Comments:*
   - Added docstrings to the methods to provide clear documentation about their purpose and usage.
   - Included comments to explain any complex logic or decision points.

2. *Readability:*
   - Improved variable names and method names to enhance code readability.
   - Ensured consistent formatting and adhered to PEP 8 style guidelines.

3. *Error Handling:*
   - Enhanced error handling in the division method by raising a ValueError for division by zero, providing better feedback to users.

4. *Efficiency:*
   - The initial implementation was kept simple, but future optimizations or improvements could be incorporated based on performance considerations.

5. *Maintainability:*
   - The refactoring aimed to make the codebase more maintainable by following best practices and making it easier for other developers to understand and contribute.
