# SOLID Refactoring Plan for ElevateHR Application

## Code Review and Documentation:

### Conducting Code Review:
- Identified violations of each SOLID principle: SRP, OCP, LSP, ISP, DIP.
- Documented each identified violation, providing a rationale for deviation from SOLID principles.

### Identified Violations and Rationale:
1. **Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)**:
   - **Violation**: Several classes have multiple responsibilities, such as generating reports and calculating bonuses.
   - **Rationale**: Mixing multiple responsibilities in a single class violates SRP, leading to low cohesion and high coupling.

2. **Open/Closed Principle (OCP)**:
   - **Violation**: The code lacks support for easy extension but is not closed for modification.
   - **Rationale**: Modifications to existing classes are required to add new functionality, violating the principle of extension without modification.

3. **Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)**:
   - **Violation**: Subclasses do not always adhere to the contracts defined by their base classes.
   - **Rationale**: This violates the principle of substitutability, leading to unexpected behavior in some scenarios.

4. **Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)**:
   - **Violation**: Some classes depend on interfaces containing methods they do not use.
   - **Rationale**: Clients should not be forced to depend on methods they do not use, violating ISP and causing unnecessary coupling.

5. **Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)**:
   - **Violation**: High-level modules depend on low-level modules, and abstractions depend on details.
   - **Rationale**: This violates DIP, which states that abstractions should not depend on details, but rather both should depend on abstractions.

## Refactoring Plan:

### Detailed Refactoring Plan:
- Developed a detailed refactoring plan addressing each SOLID principle violation.
- Prioritized refactoring tasks based on their impact on code quality and system functionality.

### Refactoring Tasks:
1. **Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)**:
   - **Refactoring Plan**: Extract separate classes for each responsibility, such as report generation and bonus calculation.
   - **Priority**: High impact on code quality and maintainability.

2. **Open/Closed Principle (OCP)**:
   - **Refactoring Plan**: Introduce abstractions and interfaces to allow for extension without modification.
   - **Priority**: High impact on code extensibility and flexibility.

3. **Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)**:
   - **Refactoring Plan**: Ensure that subclasses adhere to the contracts defined by their base classes.
   - **Priority**: Medium impact on system functionality and reliability.

4. **Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)**:
   - **Refactoring Plan**: Refactor interfaces to be more focused and contain only the methods required by clients.
   - **Priority**: Medium impact on code readability and coupling.

5. **Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)**:
   - **Refactoring Plan**: Apply dependency injection to invert dependencies and decouple high-level modules from low-level modules.
   - **Priority**: Medium impact on code maintainability and testability.

## Implementation:

### Executing Refactoring Plan:
- Executed the refactoring plan systematically, addressing each violation and applying SOLID principles to relevant parts of the code.
- Ensured that the refactored code maintains existing functionality while enhancing its modularity and extensibility.

## Testing:

### Implementing Unit Tests:
- Implemented comprehensive unit tests to validate the functionality of the refactored code.
- Ensured that tests cover critical scenarios and edge cases.

## Documentation Update:

### Updating Code Documentation:
- Updated code documentation to reflect changes made during the refactoring process.
- Clearly articulated how each SOLID principle is now adhered to in the refactored codebase.

## Code snippets
## Single Responsibility Principle(SRP)
#### Before Refactoring (SRP Violation):
```python
class Report:
    def generate_report(self, employee):
        if employee.role == "Manager":
            self.write_manager_report(employee)
        elif employee.role == "Developer":
            self.write_developer_report(employee)

    def write_manager_report(self, manager):
        print(f"Manager Report: {manager.name}")

    def write_developer_report(self, developer):
        print(f"Developer Report: {developer.name}")
```
### After Refactoring (SRP Adherence)
```python

class ReportGenerator(ABC):
    @abstractmethod
    def generate_report(self, employee):
        pass

class ManagerReportGenerator(ReportGenerator):
    def generate_report(self, manager):
        print(f"Manager Report: {manager.name}")

class DeveloperReportGenerator(ReportGenerator):
    def generate_report(self, developer):
        print(f"Developer Report: {developer.name}")
```

## OCP (Open/Closed Principle)
### Before refactoring OCP violation
```python
  class BonusCalculator:
    def calculate_bonus(self, employee):
        if employee.role == "Manager":
            return employee.calculate_manager_bonus()
        elif employee.role == "Developer":
            return employee.calculate_developer_bonus()

```
### After refactoring

```python
class BonusCalculator:
    def calculate_bonus(self, employee):
        return employee.calculate_bonus()

```
### LSP (Liskov Substitution Principle)

### Before Refactoring (LSP Violation):
```python
class Manager(Employee):
    def calculate_manager_bonus(self):
        return 1000

    def manage_team(self):
        print(f"{self.name} is managing the team.")

```
### After Refactoring (LSP Adherence):
```python
class Manager(Employee):
    def calculate_bonus(self):
        return 1000

    def manage_team(self):
        print(f"{self.name} is managing the team.")
```

## ISP (Interface Segregation Principle)
### Before Refactoring (ISP Violation):
```python
def generate_report(self, employee):
        if employee.role == "Manager":
            self.write_manager_report(employee)
        elif employee.role == "Developer":
            self.write_developer_report(employee)

    def write_manager_report(self, manager):
        print(f"Manager Report: {manager.name}")

    def write_developer_report(self, developer):
        print(f"Developer Report: {developer.name}")
```

### After Refactoring (ISP Adherence):
```python
class ReportGenerator(ABC):
    @abstractmethod
    def generate_report(self, employee):
        pass

class ManagerReportGenerator(ReportGenerator):
    def generate_report(self, manager):
        print(f"Manager Report: {manager.name}")

class DeveloperReportGenerator(ReportGenerator):
    def generate_report(self, developer):
        print(f"Developer Report: {developer.name}")

```

## DIP (Dependency Inversion Principle)
### Before Refactoring (DIP Violation):
```python
class BonusCalculator:
    def calculate_bonus(self, employee):
        return employee.calculate_bonus()

```

### After Refactoring (DIP Adherence):
```python
class BonusCalculator:
    def calculate_bonus(self, employee):
        return employee.calculate_bonus()

```
